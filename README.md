# Machine-Learning_algorithm_on-Hetartdisease_dataset
We have used python libraries:
NumPy: It is a Python library used for working with arrays.
Pandas: It is a Python library,used to analyze data.
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.
LogisticRegression: It is used forprediction and classification problems.
We have used heart disease dataset. we are classifying the peoples wheather they have heart disease or not according to features in this dataset.
We are applying ML algorithms like :

KNN algorithm
DECISION TREE algorithm
Logistic REGRESSION[a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no.]
RANDOM FOREST algorithm
Naive Bayes algorithm
Support vector machine (SVM)
